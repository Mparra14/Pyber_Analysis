# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
In this project, we were asked to analyze data for Pyber, a ride-sharing car app company;we were given data that was divided by city and by number of rides per city that also included the fare for that particular date. We had to breakdown this data by city types such as rural, suburban, and urban. Then we had to compare each city type to find the difference in fares, number of drivers or number of rides. We were also told to breakdown the data even further to only include certain dates for further analyzing,specifically January through April of 2019. In order to analyze each data set we had to use Pandas and to help visualize this outcome we used charts by Matplotlib method. 

## Results:


There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
## Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
