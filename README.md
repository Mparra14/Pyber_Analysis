# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
In this project, we were asked to analyze data for Pyber, a ride-sharing car app company;we were given data that was divided by city and by number of rides per city that also included the fare for that particular date. We had to breakdown this data by city types such as rural, suburban, and urban. Then we had to compare each city type to find the difference in fares, number of drivers or number of rides. We were also told to breakdown the data even further to only include certain dates for further analyzing,specifically January through April of 2019. In order to analyze each data set we had to use Pandas and to help visualize this outcome we used charts by Matplotlib method. 

## Results:

Looking at the summary statistics for each city type using this app, we can see that there is a a wide gap in both rural and urban cities. It becomes clear that fare is affected by the amount of drivers in that scpecific city type; the lower amount of drivers in that city type constitutes for higher ride fares. Take for example rural cities, the number of drivers is a total of 78, and their average ride fare is about $34, which makes rural city Pyber rides more expensive for rural residents, but it benefits the drivers since they are making an average of $55 in these rural cities. In urban cities we see quite the opposite since there are more drivers in urban cities the fare is less, for an average of $24 ($10 less than rural cities), but the average fare per driver is lower than those seen in rural cities for a total of $16. Suburban areas statistics's are roughly halfway between urban and rural city types. There aren't as many drivers as there are in urban cities but is still more than rural areas.

Having all of this considered, it can be said that while this data still depends on the topography of the area that Pyber is servicing, especially in rural areas which are farther from central locations, we can still conclude that having more drivers in an area raises the amount of fares. It can seen specifically in the urban cities, since there are a total of 2,405 driver the total of fares came out to be $39,854.38, while rural areas has a total of 78 drivers and the total fares were about $4,327.93. This comparison can be seen in the summary data frame below and you may also visualize this by the line graph created in this project.

## Summary:

One of the main problems Pyber may be facing, is the fact that there is a disparity in of the city types. When it comes to affordability and accessibility, the rural cities are the most affected by this
